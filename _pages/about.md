I am currently a Research Scientist at Meta AI Research. Previously, I was a Postdoctoral Researcher at Meta AI Research with Professor Abhinav Gupta. My thesis work, “Hybrid Soft Sensing in Robotic Systems”, was completed with Professor Carmel Majidi in the Soft Machines Lab at Carnegie Mellon University.

My research focuses on developing soft and stretchable sensors for robotic applications. This includes sensing skins for hybrid robots (conventional robots with compliant surfaces) and fully-soft robots (robots made of completely compliant materials). 

Moving forward, I am currently investigating soft sensor integration and the corresponding systems engineering challenges. Ultimately, I want to know what it takes to use soft sensors in real-world applications.
<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
