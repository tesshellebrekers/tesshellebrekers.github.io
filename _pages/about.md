I am currently a Research Scientist at Meta AI Research. Previously, I was a Postdoctoral Researcher at Meta AI Research with Professor Abhinav Gupta. My thesis work, “Hybrid Soft Sensing in Robotic Systems”, was completed with Professor Carmel Majidi in the Soft Machines Lab at Carnegie Mellon University.

My research focuses on developing soft and stretchable sensors for robotic applications. This includes sensing skins for hybrid robots (conventional robots with compliant surfaces) and fully-soft robots (robots made of completely compliant materials). 

Moving forward, I am currently investigating soft sensor integration and the corresponding systems engineering challenges. Ultimately, I want to know what it takes to use soft sensors in real-world applications.
